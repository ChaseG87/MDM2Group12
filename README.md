######This is the working repository of MDM2's Second Term Group 12.


###It contains 2 working stages of the lambda calculus evaluator: lambda_reader.py and lambda_reader2.py.

lambda_reader.py is an outdated version that parses through strings directly and is limited in its computational ability.
lambda_reader2.py is the most updated version that parses through lists of strings and functional objects.


###To see the lambda_reader2.py in action simply call the program to run and it will show and example multiplication of 4 times 4.
